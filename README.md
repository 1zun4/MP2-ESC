# MP2_ESC
Multi-Platform, Modular, Powerful ESC

Design Goals of this ESC:
1) decent power (18 FET, so 100-300A should be possible depeding of FET choice, Bus Bars, and cooling)
2) relatively compact design, fitting for ebikes / medium-large electric scooters, and cheap to order
3) modular, with easily replaceable modules (both bluepill and blackpill compatible hardware wise, 12V and 5V DC-DC stages are modules also)
4) standard footprint parts, so replacement parts can be found easily in case of original parts out of stock or out of production
5) optimized for low cost production by JLCPCB, including SMT assembly.
